# Dart DS Algo

I want to start learning Dart language. So I thought - what better way than going through all the DS algo problems I've solved using Dart

Contains code snippets to understand Dart. will be covering the blind 75, neetcode, algo-monster & structy purely in dart, using it's rich programming features

I will try to document the nuances in my app - [Tech Quest](https://tiny.one/techquestapp) problems with the tag `dart` will have solutions solved using the Dart language.

- [Structy.net](./lib/structy)
